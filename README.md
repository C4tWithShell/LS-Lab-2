# LS-Lab-2 - Container Orchestration & Load-balancing
In this lab, you will learn how to work with the containerization of applications/microservices and their load-balancing, and also find out how this differs from real host virtualization and when it is more efficient. 
The lab goal is to deploy so called containers cluster farm between the team members (team of 2). Every team member builds own Docker container and one of them Docker Swarm to run orchestration. Deployment of containers to be done in Virtual Machine, and then manually conÔ¨Ågured a load balancer.
